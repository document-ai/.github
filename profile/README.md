## üìã Project Overview

DocmentAI is an AI-powered tool that helps users‚Äîwhether students, researchers, or professionals‚Äîunderstand complex documents and generate meaningful derivative content from them. By integrating advanced LLM-based capabilities, DocmentAI goes beyond mere document analysis to support question-answering, summarization, and content creation, all with an intuitive user experience.

### **Objectives**
- **Primary**: Develop a platform that provides advanced document understanding, question-answering, summarization, and automated content creation.
- **Secondary**: Enable seamless interaction for users with document uploads, contextual memory, and workflow automation.

## üöß Problem Statement & Motivation

Many AI tools excel in understanding or organizing documents, yet they often lack functionalities for generating new content or helping users effectively utilize document insights. 

### **Motivation**  
DocmentAI fills this gap by offering an application that assists users not only in understanding complex documents but also in creating derivative content (e.g., papers, presentations). This approach can save significant time and enhance information actionability.

## üìê Project Scope

### **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features**
- **Document Upload and Management**:
  - Support for multiple file types (e.g., PDF, Word).
  - Secure storage and easy access to uploaded documents.
  
- **Document Summarization and Key Insights**:
  - Generate summaries that capture core information from long documents.
  - Provide key highlights and statistics from data-dense sections.

- **Interactive Q&A over Documents**:
  - Allow users to ask questions about their documents using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  - Support contextual memory to remember user interactions and questions.

- **Content Creation and Assistance**:
  - Generate outlines, introductions, and structured content for papers based on uploaded material.
  - Automate creation of slide decks with essential points extracted from documents.

- **Study Aids**:
  - Generate quizzes or flashcards based on document content.
  - Highlight important sections for focused study sessions.

### **Future/Optional Features**
- Multi-language support for document analysis and summarization.
- Advanced knowledge graph construction to visualize connections across documents.
- Team collaboration features for shared access to document-based insights.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

### **Backend**
- **Framework**: FastAPI or Django REST for managing API endpoints.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user information, document metadata, and session history.
- **LLM Integration**: LangChain for managing document workflows and using models via OpenAI or Hugging Face.

### **Frontend**
- **Framework**: React or Vue.js for a responsive, user-friendly interface.
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API to handle application state.
- **UI Libraries**: ShadCD or others for styling and pre-built components.

### **Deployment**
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS or Linode.
- **Containerization**: K8s and Docker for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Backend
  - Frontend
  - Traefik Proxy/load balancer
  - PostgreSQL
  - Weaviate
  - pgAdmin (in development only)

All infrastructure will be managed in one repository that defines the Terraform modules, and one infrastructure-live repository that manages all deployed infrastructure using and parameterizing the infrastructure-modules. It will also offer GitHub Actions workflows to trigger upgrades to the infrastructure, which can be utilized by the backend and frontend repositories in their CI/CD pipelines for continuous delivery. This keeps infrastructure management decoupled from application repositories.

For development, Minikube will be used locally to deploy the cluster and connect to running containers. A deployment script will be provided to help developers instantiate the local cluster and set everything up automatically, along with commands to deploy and shut down the local cluster.

## üìä Architecture Overview

### **High-Level Architecture Diagram**
*Include a flow diagram showing interaction between frontend, backend, database, and LLM APIs.*

### **Data Flow**
1. User uploads a document, which is stored in a database.
2. Backend processes the document, sending data to an LLM API for summarization, Q&A, or content creation.
3. Processed data and insights are returned to the frontend for display.

## üë• User Personas & Use Cases

### **User Personas**
- **Academic Researcher**: Needs assistance with understanding complex papers, extracting insights, and creating derivative content.
- **University Student**: Wants study aids, question-answering, and help with writing academic essays.
- **Corporate Knowledge Worker**: Requires fast access to insights and presentation materials from lengthy reports.

### **Primary Use Cases**
- **Document Analysis**: User uploads a research paper, and DocmentAI generates a summary and answers questions.
- **Content Creation**: A student uploads course materials, and DocmentAI generates a draft for a term paper or presentation.
- **Study Aids**: User uploads notes and generates quizzes for review.
